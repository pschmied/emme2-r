emme2-r
=======

R package to read datasets from the EMME/2 travel modeling software

Original CRAN Package from
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emme2/index.html

This version adds a handful of convenience functions, and catches an
edge case in which multiple matrices share the same 6-character name.
